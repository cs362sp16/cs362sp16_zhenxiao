when I running my card test, I found there is a bug in his smithy card, my smithy card test has failed assertion: draw card incorrect. 

int function_renamed_smithy(struct gameState *state,int currentPlayer, int handPos){

	  
 // change this cards to function

      	  //+3 Cards

	  // add bugs

	  int i;

	  
      for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
	{

	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

	}

			
      //discard card from hand
 
     	discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

	 return 0;

 }

in function function_renamed_smithy, line 5, for(i = 0; i<2; i++) should be for(i = 0; i<3; i++), because it should add 3 cards.
