when I running my card test, I found there is a bug in his Council_room card, my Council_room card test has failed assertion: draw card incorrect. 

int function_renamed_council_room(struct gameState *state,int currentPlayer,int handPos){

	  	//changed to function
     
 		//+4 Cards

		 // add bugs

	  int i;

	  
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{

	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

	}

			
      //+1 Buy

      	state->numBuys++;
	
		
      //Each other player draws a card
 
     	for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++)
	{

	  if ( i != currentPlayer )
	    {

	      drawCard(i, state);

	    }

	}

			
      //put played card in played card pile

      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

	return 0;

	  
  }
In line 7, for(i = 0; i<3; i++) shoud be for(i=0; i<4; i++) because it should add 4 cards.
