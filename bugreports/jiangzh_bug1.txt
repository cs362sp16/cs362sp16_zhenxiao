when I used card test, I found in jiangzh's dominion.c , there is a bug in his Village card, my Village card test canot pass his function. Get wrong actions.

int village_function(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

   
 state->numActions = state->numActions + 3;

   
 discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

   
 return 0;

}

in line 3, state->numActions shoud plus 2.
