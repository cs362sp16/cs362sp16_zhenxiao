When I used my randomadvanture test, I found there is bug in his advanture card function. I cannot pass my test.  Get wrong coins.

int adventurer_function(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer){
   
  int drawntreasure = 0;
  
  int cardDrawn;
 
  int z = 1;
  
  int temphand[MAX_HAND];

  
  while(drawntreasure < 2){
    
    if(state->deckCount[currentPlayer] < 1)
      
      shuffle(currentPlayer, state);

  
      drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
    
      cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];

  
   if(cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
             	      drawntreasure++;
    
    else{
        
        temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
     
        state->handCount[currentPlayer]--;
       
        z++;
       
       }
  
  }

the initialize z should equal 0;
